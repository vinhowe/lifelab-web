A self-improvement service. Currently just a toy. The big ideas are:

- Capturing pain
- Experimenting with habits to see what works for you

Software development is my hammer. LifeLab is my take on personal improvement using ideas from software development. Here's how it works:

- Capture issues related to pain points or areas for improvement in your life.
- Create experiments that run for 2-week periods--"iterations."
- Every day, check in on the active experiments. Reflecting on the day before, make adjustments to the experiments. These daily check-ins are the key to "what works for you."
- At the end of every iteration, review your active experiments. If they've been easy sailing and you're ready for them to become habits, mark them as "committed." If they still need some work, just bump their end dates to the end of the next iteration in two weeks and leave them marked as "active."
